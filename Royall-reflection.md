#Reflection 
* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
    - I wasn't struggling with any of the concepts prior to the session
* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
    - I don't think our pair required concept clarification, as much as just being mindful of *git status* command use and some new commands/shortcuts. Example: clarified the use of the *ls* command and learned about auto-complete feature with tab in terminal. 
* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
    - Questions asked were for clarifying the assignment directions. 
* What still confuses you about Git?
    - I am not confused about Git in terms of what we have learned so far. 
* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
    - First experience was great! We went over our time, but had a good mix of driving/navigation. Established good rapport in the beginning with the check-in and at the end with a wrap up.
