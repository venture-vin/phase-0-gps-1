What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
The git concepts that I was struggling before the session were the merge concept, merge conflicts and the pull request.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
During the session all the concepts were clarified. My pair knew the concepts and she help me by explaining and showing me how to do it.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
Some questions that I ask my pair was about how she was doing? How was going to drive and navigate? and when I did not understood about the merge and pull request I ask my pair and she explain it to me, that was great. We ask our guide about merge conflict and if the way that we resolve was correct, and we got stuck we ask her for help, we got stuck in how to make a code block syntax on markdown.

What still confuses you about Git?
How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
So far I am not confused about Git anymore, after the session some of the concepts became more clear. Thanks to Olya, my pair for explaining me and helping me in some Git concepts, I am not confused with those concepts but Im goint to practice more using those concepts. My first experience of pairing session was great. My partner is friendly, kind she help me in things that I did not know. We both work together in the session, we asked questions, we disccussa and we learn new things in the session. The pair sessions are great way to work together and help each other.
